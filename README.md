Mastermind game. An intersting quirk of the game is that the rules are somewhat
unclear on wether doubles are allowed or not. Some say doubles are allowed
while others do not. Because it would be harder to program,
doubles are incorporated in this version of the game. This means that if the
code contains one color in a specific  position and you place that same color in the
right position in your input and another piece of the same color that is not
in the right input then the program will you only have one piece that is the
correct color and the correct color. It will NOT say that the other piece 
matches the color that is in the code. This is how the game was programmed
in other online versions and it made sense to me to follow suite and program
it accordingly.
